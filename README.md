# Professor Bot

## Purpose
- Professor Bot manages the introductory process, the 'registration', of new users. Initially it will only serve as a way to
assign basic roles as well as give the new players their first pokemon. In the future, this bot will also be responsible
for all necessary API requests for true registration of users into a database.

## Roles Assignable
- Can assign new users with the 'Trainer' role.
